# Algorithm Practice (JavaScript)

This repository is a personal learning log for algorithm practice using JavaScript.

## Purpose
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Understand algorithms deeply by writing code step by step
- Record learning progress continuously

## How I Study
- Solve algorithm problems by myself
- Use ChatGPT as a learning partner to clarify concepts and logic
- Refactor and improve code after understanding the correct approach

## Contents
- Basic loops and conditions
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort)
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Higher-order functions
- Gradual progression to more complex problems

## Notes
This repository focuses not only on correct answers but also on the learning process and improvements.
